# Full Stack App with React and a REST API

In this project, I used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (that I created in a previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database. Additionally, users will be required to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

I used my knowledge of JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion, React Router to set up my routes, Axios to fetch data from my REST API, basic authentication to support users signing in.

It was exciting and challenging to complete this project. I have learned a lot in the four months in my techdegree program and feel so accomplished. I am also eager to continue to learn and grow in this field.
